    <section class="origin">
        <h2>Why I Created LinJutsu</h2>
        <p>
            I created LinJutsu to be my own journey mate in cybersecurity.
            It's where I collect what I learn — especially from working in the Linux terminal — and put it into
            practice.
            I'm not here to show off. This is where I make mistakes, fix them, try again, and grow.
            I also added my love for Naruto (especially Shikamaru 😄) into the mix, because strategy and calm thinking
            really fit how I work.
            This site is mine, but also open for anyone walking the same path.
        </p>
        <p class="ninja-path">
            It’s my way of mastering my own Jutsu — one command at a time.<br>
            This is my ninja path —<br>
            but through cybersecurity.

        <!-- 🥷 Who I am -->
    <section class="whoiam">
        <h2>🔮 Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
            I’m not just someone studying cybersecurity — I’m living it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I question everything. I look for patterns others miss.<br>
            I’m drawn to what’s hidden, what’s protected, what’s broken — and I want to understand all of it.<br>
            Firewalls, exploits, malware, logic flaws — they aren’t just topics.<br>
            They’re a language. And I’m learning to speak it fluently.
        </p>
        <p>
            What pulls me in is curiosity — not fear.<br>
            The thrill of discovering what’s underneath, of seeing how systems can be protected — or taken apart.<br>
            Cybersecurity is how I think, how I observe, how I move.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s not just a field I chose.<br>
            It’s how I see the world.
        </p>
        <p class="identity">
            That’s me.<br>
            I’m <strong>Hafsa</strong>.<br>
            And <strong>LinJutsu</strong> is the path I’ve carved —<br>
            quiet, precise, mine.
        </p>

    <!-- ❤️ Final Note -->
    <section class="note">
        <p>
            I don’t care about being fancy. I just want to keep learning and building.
            If LinJutsu helps anyone else along the way, that's a win.
